- No racism/sexism/homophobia/transphobia/rape rp/use of N or R words, among others

- No harassing other players, sexual or otherwise. Anything that leads to repeat aggressive pressure or borders on intimidation on an OOC level is against the server rules. This does not mean you can avoid RP conflicts or IC consequences, but if you have tried meaningful IC resolutions and still believe you are being harassed, open a ticket and staff can help advise or mediate.

 

- Zero third party communication while on server, and no coordinating IC events OOC. This can all be done IC. ANYTHING that would persuade your actions IC, including where you go, who you meet up with, what you are preparing to do, is META.

- Whitelisted jobs require 10 hrs minimum game time, and 7 days in the server from the date your ID was registered IC,  or a successful in character interview with a leading member of the respective office.

Hostile Roleplay Rules

RDM / VDM
- You cannot kill or injure someone with your horse or wagon without having a legitimate interaction with them. Very Simple.
 

- You cannot initiate or kill someone without adequate verbal RP happening first.
 

- Amount of RP required before initiation is a case by case basis, some scenes will not require as much RP as others. It is on you to decide and defend yourself after the fact when pulled into a ticket.
​

- Your character does not know what a NPC is and as far as your Character is concerned (and our lovely rules) Locals are just like our fellow players. Killing a local with ZERO interaction is considered RDM.


Roleplay before Gunplay
- In every scenario, always roleplay before resorting to violence. 
 

- Never start a scenario with roping or gunplay. 
 

- You always need to interact and talk first.
 

- If your actions are not starting or continuing your story or someone else's story, rethink what you are doing.

- Do not abuse teleport entrances/doors. In the case of the casino boat in Saint Denis, any gang or group with hostile intentions must arrive via a player driven boat.

 

- Sheriffs, Lawmen, Rangers and Marshals can defend towns with up to 12 players. They cannot chase a robbery of any kind with more than 6
 


Robbing / Griefing
- You can only take a half of each item stack in someone's inventory. Single items can be taken

​

- You cannot rob and kill. Pick one or the other! This includes robbing horses or wagons.

-During a robbery there may only be ONE individual within the group, per person that you rob, to check through pockets. This is to prevent taking more than half a stack, etc. Designate the individual that looks through peoples pockets beforehand. There shouldn't be 3 people looking through a singular individual's pockets.

​

- Backpacks and handbags can be taken, including everything inside

​

- If you take something from someone, then you cannot put it back to kill that player and say you didn't rob them

- On-Duty Lawmen cannot have their long arms stolen. All other robbery rules still apply. This is to prevent law being seen as 'loot bags' when they have low population.

​

- If you are being robbed, you must still fear for your life even though you as a person know your character won't die

​

- Do not take property, doctor, train or law keys

​

- You can only take long guns visible on the player and any handguns visible.

​

- Conceal carried M1899 and Snubnosed Schofield are robable at any time

​

- You cannot take custom items ie. custom recipe books 

​

- Customized weapons can be taken

​

- Wagon and horse bag contents can be robbed, but the person robbing the wagon or horse must RP with the owner of the wagon or horse before taking anything at all. There are no limits to what can be taken from a wagon or horse, protect them.

- You (or your gang) should not be chain robbing stores or banks.

-You (or your gang) can rob a bank 7 times a week, 1/day.

-You (or your gang) can rob a fort 7 times a week, 1/day.

-You (or your gang) can rob a store 2 times per day, with a 2 hour cooldown.
 


Revenge RP
- Cooldown of 1hr before seeking violent revenge once a scene is not active

​

- A scene is still active if the aggressors are within line of sight.
 

- The cooldown applies to only the person(s) that was the victim.


NVL / Fear RP
- You must value your life at all times as if it were real. 

​

- You must value the life of other people as well, you cannot shoot or injure your friends just to “play around”

​

- In 1v1 and 1v2 situations, the victim is allowed to defend themselves reasonably if they see an opening. Record your gameplay!

​

- Weapons such as holstered and equipped sidearms can only be hipfired and as a self defense when you are in a 1v1 or 1v2 situation, and ONLY when you see a realistic moment of the attacker letting their guard down, Such as lowering their weapon or looking another direction etc. 

​

- This does not allow firing without verbal interaction and an initial compliance and acknowledgement to the scene.

​

- These situations may become a case by case ruling in a staff ticket so you should always consider them to be secondary to complying with the attacker and rolling with the RP. Oftentimes getting robbed can lead to great RP.

​

- There is a difference between someone aiming a gun at you, and someone just holding a gun in their hands.

​

- NVL is a case by case ruling, not every situation is the same. We will side with the evidence presented, you need to clip or record hostile RP.

​

- When someone has a gun pointed at you while in close range, trying to use a lasso is power gaming. Especially so if you don't have it in your hands. Do not abuse game mechanics to get the win.


Vigilantism
- This rule is here to ensure that the Law / Criminal RP in robberies of banks / stores is not interfered with by outside parties.

​

- If you see a bank or store robbery going down, don't try and help either side unless you are a part of that scene from the start.

​

- Vigilantism is judged on a case by case basis, if you are a part of hostile RP you are expected to record or be able to clip your RP scenes.

​

- As always, you’re only allowed to do hostile RP with 6 people. See gang rules.


Duels
- Duels with “Cork/Wax” Rounds” are not allowed unless it is authorized by staff via a ticket.
 

- If you want an event with duels please make a ticket.
 

- When in a duel you cannot walk or move or the duel is void.

- Duels are no longer only for the permadeath of a character! If two players want to duel, they will be able to put something on the line other than their character's lives if they choose. A ticket needs to be opened and the users will discuss with a staff member what is at stake for each person. This can be almost anything, such as an expensive gun or horse, property or a business and even their lives like old duels.

​

- As long as these stakes do not violate our current rules, and make sense, then anything goes. These agreements will be enforced OOC and breaking them will constitute a serious rule break. Additionally, the attempted murder charge will no longer be given to the winner of the duel.

​

This is how the process will work:

- One of the duelists will submit a ticket and tag the other. Then, the stakes will be outlined in the ticket.

​

- An agreement will be reached regarding the stakes and a time for the duel will be set up

​

- The duel will take place (THIS DUEL MUST BE RECORDED AND SUBMITTED TO THE ORIGINAL TICKET WHEN COMPLETED)

​

- Staff will view the recording and review, and any arrangements needed to complete the agreement will be made

​

- The loser of the duel, must then seek medical treatment for their injuries. This medical RP is mandatory of all duels and requires RP with an actual human, not taking the local doctor.

 Dueling Rules

- Stand at the agreed distance away from the person you are dueling

- Both players put their hands up

- Both players should only have a single pistol equipped

- On the agreed starting mark, put down hands and fire

- Again, you have to stand still!


Body Dumping
- Do not double drop bodies, ex.dropping a body and pretending to leave hoping they call a doc then you go move them again. This is power gaming. NO EXCEPTIONS. If you are forced to drop a body in a location unintended, that still counts as your drop if you step away from that body, as they assume it’s safe to call a doctor.

​

- You cannot camp a body waiting for a doc to show up

​

- You can dump bodies in any location, including water.
 

- However, please keep in mind that it eliminates RP for the players. If you wish to progress a story for yourself or others it will not always be realistic to body dump in water. Please consider this when you are dumping in water. Conflict breeds RP, and forgetting everything does not.

​

- If you are dumped in a location where you could not realistically ever be found, do not call a doctor.

​

- You can watch a body you have dropped from a distance, but cannot interfere with the recovery.

​

- You can only water dump a body 1 time per 48 hours

​

- Do not sit unconscious waiting for a player doc any longer than 30 minutes.


Torture RP
- You must get consent from the party you plan to torture. Please get consent using /do.
 

- Example: /do Clarence holds his knife to Jim’s eye, clearly wanting to cut it out, just waiting for the right moment.

- In this example Clarence would need to wait for a sign from Jim to move forward. Without a /do in return torture cannot proceed.
 

- Example: /do Looking for torture permission.

- In this example it’s quite blunt what the player wants to happen, but it needs to be clear to protect the person being tortured.

- Without a /do in return torture cannot proceed.
 

- If you torture someone, you are automatically consenting to be tortured in the future by that same person, not everyone.
 

- The person being tortured still gets to pick their wounds. Do not make assumptions on how successful your torturing was until you see that player next and can confirm it!


Greenzones
- Doctors offices are a green zone and you cannot engage in hostile RP here.
 

- The interior of a law office should not have hostile RP inside from the people that are being arrested.
 

- Law offices are green zones and you should not be trying to break into one. If you want to save your gang members, you need to do it on a transport.

- You cannot use hostages outside to try to break someone out of jail.

- You SHOULD NOT be using green zones (doc office and law office) as personal protection zones to avoid hostile RP. Those offices are green zones to allow med RP and Law RP to take place without hostile interruption. If you want to seek shelter for protection, do it in a different building. Abuse of this will result in consequences.

-Fleeing to a greenzone while involved in an active hostile scene revokes the greenzone protection on the fleeing player only.


Ropes
- You cannot break free from hogties unless someone loosens them up for you first.
 

- You cannot leave someone handcuffed.
 

- If you are being dragged or are lassoed at a range, you can use your knife to break free.
 

- You must fully hogtie someone to prevent them from breaking out, just having someone at the end of your lasso is not hogtying.

​

- Do not leave someone hogtied at a menu location so they cant break out of loosened ropes.

​

- If they don't loosen your ropes, you can break free in 5 minutes if left unattended.

​

- Do not press Z or "ragdoll" to avoid being hogtied. This is Powergaming.


Breaking Character / OOC
- You must remain in character at all times.
 

- Saying “out of character” will not be tolerated. 
 

- Even if someone breaks a rule against you, that does not give you the right to break a rule in return.
 

- Refrain from using the word “spiritually” as this is a direct reference to OOC.
 

- Talking about the “Government” is referencing staff, again this is OOC talk.


Fail RP
- FailRP is doing something unrealistic or rule breaking

​

- Like farming in the water, snow, on rocks.. 

​

- Talking ooc (Out Of Character)

​

- Shooting off limbs

​

- Shit talking downed bodies excessively. One or two lines, perhaps. Never more.

- Using modern day terminology

​

- Using a friend or gang member as a hostage is Fail roleplay

​

 - Failure to RP your injuries will be considered failRP and will result in punishment.

- Pretending that a game mechanic is causing you issues when in a scene. For example, claiming you cannot put your hands up or are experiencing a headache to get out of hostile RP.

​

- Supernatural RP

- This is defined as playing as a vampire, werewolf, mythical creature, something similar, or using “magic” spells to force others to do things

- Treat this rule similar to torture RP, it requires consent if you are doing something to someone they might not know about or be familiar with (like with voodoo)

- Keep this realistic with the time period, voodoo was a big thing back then, but the end results were never very often real.

​

- Playing clips, sound bits, and music through your mic is not allowed.Use your real voice. Singers/performers can play their own music and instruments through their mic

​

- You cannot let OOC actions affect your in character actions.

​

- You may have streams up while playing, but they must be muted. You cannot use any information from another stream, EVER. 

​

- Hearing something from someone's stream and  going into the server and using that information is Metagaming.

​

- Reading a discord post and then relaying that information within the game is Metagaming.

​

- Seeing someone find the Blackmarket on a stream then going to that location in game is Metagaming.

​

- Only use information that your character has learned while playing on the server. 

​

- Discord messages are only usable if someone has “slipped something in your pocket” in RP such as a picture or note that they could not realistically give you in the game itself.


- No third party calls while on the server. Includes discord.

-When engaged in an ongoing conflict between two parties, if you have characters on both sides, you must choose which side to RP on until the conflict is resolved. This will help prevent metagaming.


Powergaming
- Powergaming is the act of always having to win at any means or cost. 

​

- Putting a camp storage or chest right next to where you are mining or farming can be powergaming if you “teleport” goods by moving your camp and skipping the use of a wagon.

​

- Whistling for your horse that someone stole from you to bring it back is powergaming.

​

- A power gamer is easy to spot as winning is the most important thing to them instead of a story. Don't fall into this trap, the story is the victory here.

​

- Robbing or shooting someone in any kind of menu

​

- Putting something in your wagon in one town, returning the wagon to the stable boy, then taking the wagon out in another town is power gaming. You need to transport your goods!

​

- MANDATORY to have a secondary holster when dual wielding unless your secondary is an 1899 or snub nosed schofield

- If a player brings you to a NPC nurse, or a player doctor revives you then nothing is forgotten unless you chose to forget. 

​

- You can still RP forgetting the scene due to injury if you are revived by NPC or player doctors.

​

- In summary, you are only forced to lose 30 minutes of memory if you PRESS E to respawn


Baiting
- Baiting lawmen or doctors is not allowed. That means, use of alerts to call docs and law to a scene. if all done through RP, it is not considered baiting.
 

- Do not kill yourself or others to bait doctors.


Voice ID
- If someone is wearing a face covering you must identify that person by means other than their voice. A variety of things can lead to a positive ID, such as their clothes, their buckle, their guns, their horse/wagon, or even their vocal mannerisms and motivations or similar, repeated actions, creating a pattern.
 

- Consider people playing multiple characters as well. If someone is unmasked and insisting they are not who you say they are, you need to respect that and move on.
 

- Not everyone can change their voice and would still like to play multiple characters. Keep this in mind when you run across someone that sounds familiar but has a different name! Respect their choice to RP someone else even if it is the same voice.

​

- If you have not been interacted with in the last 15 minutes after being downed you can take a local doc as long as the scene is not active.

​​

- If your game crashes during an active scene, you MUST attempt to login as quickly as possible to finish the scene AND communicate through a ticket in discord that the incident happened.

​

- Do not use bright flashy text colors or background colors.

​

- Keep the word count as low as possible! 

​

- If we have to, we will restrict this down, please use it responsibly so we don't have to remove it.
